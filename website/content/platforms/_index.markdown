## Recommended: Raspberry Pi 4 or Pi 5

gokrazy development happens primarily on the Raspberry Pi 5, but the Pi 4 is
also a great choice!

## Continuous Integration (CI) {#ci}

Appliances which are marked in <strong>bold</strong> are tested in the CI
setup on real hardware and gate new kernel and firmware versions, and hence
can be considered supported.

Non-bold appliances are supported in a best-effort way, meaning they might be
temporarily broken at HEAD.

The leading <code>github.com</code> in front of package import paths has been omitted for space reasons.

## Performance

The turbojpeg encoding column is the result of running scan2drive’s [`turbojpeg`
micro-benchmark](https://github.com/stapelberg/scan2drive/blob/9856bfff7118111062998dc5034b9f7e4709101b/internal/turbojpeg/bench_test.go)

The json column is the result of running the `json` benchmark from the
[x/benchmarks repo](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/benchmarks).

| Hardware    | turbojpeg encoding | json   |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| raspi5b     | 0.32s              | 24ms   |
| raspi4b     | 1.00s              | 38ms   |

| raspizero2w | 1.04s              | 184ms  |

## Power Usage

These power measurements were done using a [myStrom WiFi
Switch](https://mystrom.ch/de/wifi-switch/) with measurement feature.

The Raspberry Pi 4 and Pi 5 were using their original Raspberry Pi power supply,
the others were measured with a random USB power supply.

An Ethernet cable was connected in all tests, WiFi was not enabled.

## gokrazy kernel repository map

### Officially supported kernels

These kernels are tested in [Continuous Integration](#ci).

They are built from one of two sources: Either from Raspberry Pi’s Linux kernel
fork, or from the upstream Linux kernel from [kernel.org].

The upstream Linux kernel gets security fixes the quickest, but the Raspberry Pi
Linux kernel supports more Raspberry Pi models (notably the Pi 5, which upstream
does not support) and peripherals.

### Community-supported kernels

Independently from the officially supported gokrazy kernels listed above, people
of our community provide alternative kernels and firmwares, in order to run
gokrazy on unsupported platform or to provide new features. They may not be as
thoroughly tested as the official platforms. Please report any issue to their
respective repository.

## Community-supported platforms {#community}

This section provides more details for community-supported platforms.

### Community-supported Odroid XU4/HC1/HC2

Odroid XU4/HC1/HC2 is based on a Samsung Exynos 5422 SOC (4 ARM Cortex-A15
cores and 4 ARM Cortex-A7 cores) and has been on the market since ~2016. HC1
and HC2 variants support installing a 2.5'/3.5' hard drive on board.

Kernel for these devices is available at [github.com/anupcshan/gokrazy-odroidxu4-kernel].
This package contains a recent kernel, U-boot and some binary blobs that are
required to initiate the boot process. It has been tested against Odroid HC2
hardware with gigabit networking, USB and HDD functional.

See [github.com/anupcshan/odroidbake] for an example on how to create a
new disk image.

### Community-supported Rock64

Pine64 Rock64 is based on a Rockchip RK3328 SOC (4 ARM Cortex-A53 cores)
and has been on the market since ~2017.

Kernel for these devices is available at [github.com/anupcshan/gokrazy-rock64-kernel].
This package contains a recent kernel and mainline U-boot required to initiate
the boot process. These have been tested against real hardware with gigabit networking
and USB working under Gokrazy.

Usage of eMMC module is not supported yet - [github.com/gokrazy/gokrazy/issues/270].
